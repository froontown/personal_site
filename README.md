# Welcome to Froontown!

## What is Froontown?
[Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football](http://www.mobygames.com/game/mike-ditka-ultimate-football) was a game my brothers and I got way back on our then-awesome 486 DOS machine, (I don't remember if it was 33mhz or 66mhz, but I think I remember it had a 'turbo' button.) You could make your own teams, and my brother one day took a previous nickname of mine, "Froon", and made a team of his own: "Froontown."

For some reason, it stuck, and the nickname Froontown was born.

## What Is This Repo?
I'm a junior web developer learning his way around various languages. I've got a few repos where I'm documenting what I'm learning, ([JavaScript](https://github.com/froontown/js-30), [Python](https://github.com/froontown/learn_python), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/froontown/learn-bootstrap), and [React](https://github.com/froontown/learn_react).)

This little place will be where I try to put it all together with the magic of Rails. I expect a lot of it to be broken for a long time coming! Woo hoo! I'll be updating it as I go.

If you want to see stuff I've worked on that works, check these out:

**Boston Bar Review**
[github](https://github.com/aimeebachari/boston-bar-review) | [Heroku](http://boston-bar-review.herokuapp.com/)

* Boston Bar Review was a 2-week group project simulating a work environment at Launch Academy. Check it out!

**SoundBug**
[github](https://github.com/froontown/sound_bug) | [Heroku](https://soundbug.herokuapp.com/)

* SoundBug was initially a 2-week solo capstone project at Launch Academy. I plan on developing it more from the initial goal of "Make something that works" and "try to make it use React!" to incorporating tech like Wavesurfer.js, JavaScript instruments, and a few other ideas.

### Updates

* 3/19/2017: Started all over from scratch.
