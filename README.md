# Welcome to Froontown!

## What is Froontown?
[Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football](http://www.mobygames.com/game/mike-ditka-ultimate-football) was a game my brothers and I got way back on our then-awesome 486 DOS machine, (I don't remember if it was 33mhz or 66mhz, but I think I remember it had a 'turbo' button.) You could make your own teams, and my brother one day took a previous nickname of mine, "Froon", and made a team of his own: "Froontown."

For some reason, it stuck, and the nickname Froontown was born.

## What Is This Repo?
I'm a junior web developer learning his way around various languages. I've got a few repos where I'm documenting what I'm learning, ([JavaScript](https://github.com/froontown/js-30), [Python](https://github.com/froontown/learn_python), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/froontown/learn-bootstrap), and [React](https://github.com/froontown/learn_react),) and I want this personal site to one day demonstrate a little of it all.

It's probably going to be a busted site for a long time coming. I'll update it as I go.
